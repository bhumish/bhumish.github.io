Hello you! Since 3 months I was preparing for the Network+ and CCNA certifications. I had planned to appear for the N+ after my final exams and CCNA after gaining some industrial experience with computer networks.

Then I had a thought of appearing for the N+ during my reading vacations before the final exams – so as I can give my full time for job hunting after the university exams. And on 27th I went to the Pearson VUE Exam Centre, Baroda for my first networking certification exams. I was fully prepared for the exams – intense work for 1 week – from CBT Nuggets, Network+ Study Guide by Todd Lammle and my practical experience in the industry during my college projects. And my hard work showed the results – passed the exams with 790 marks! I am very glad to have such a glorious result in my first ever networking certification. Now eagerly waiting for the certification kit with hard copy of the certificate having my name printed on it!
