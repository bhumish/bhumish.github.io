```python
print "Hello World!"
```

These days I was busy with college work and exams. I learnt Python some months back, and found it very interesting to work with. My sources of learning Python were Head First Python (O'Reilly) and Beginning Python (Wiley Publishing), plus some online tutorials. While my first and favourite source was Python exercises on [CodeAcademy](http://www.codecademy.com/). Hence, afterwards I made an exercise on that website for playing Rock Paper Scissors. You know that the coding of such program is too easy, but the backside validation for the user inputs was much tricky. Willing to make some more exercises at an advanced level.

The Rock Paper Scissors exercise, after some beta testing by the website peeps, is available here: [Rock Paper Scissors on Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/courses/python-intermediate-en-t5dl0/)
