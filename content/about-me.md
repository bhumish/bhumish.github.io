*This is my personal journal where I write articles mostly about Information Security. I enjoy the world of Security - be it related to software or hardware or cloud. I have been a part of this domain since almost 12 years, where I started the official journey with getting a Master&rsquo;s degree in Network Security, and then started working professionally with various organizations. I have worked in many fields of security, including Vulnerability Management, Application Security, Security Analystics, Threat Hunting, Forensics, Penetration Testing, Auditing.*

*Currently working as a Security Engineer, researching and guiding on various aspects of security and embedding them into the SDLC.*

## About this blog

*I have been maintaining this blog since 2012. Earlier this was on Wordpress, which still has most of the content till 2018, then briefly I moved to Medium, and then created my own using [Hugo site generator](https://gohugo.io) and hosted in my home-lab. This has been under some migrations hence some posts were lost - though most of you won't miss them.*

*Currently this is hosted on Github Pages and the Hugo theme is [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod). There are no heavy scripts or analytics on this page.*

*All the opinions/views posted here are my own, and I do not represent my employer here.*
